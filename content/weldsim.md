        [WELDSIM](https://github.com/dlmpal/weldsim) is an AMReX-based code for simulating heat-transfer during arc-welding in plates. It uses the finite-volume method combined with adaptive mesh refinement to solve a transient, nonlinear heat equation that models the transfer of thermal energy from the welding electrode to the plate specimen.
