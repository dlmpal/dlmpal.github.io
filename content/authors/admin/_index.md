<!-- ## About Me -->
I am a mechanical engineering graduate from the National Technical University of Athens, where I focused on computational methods and optimization. The subject of my diploma thesis was Multidisciplinary Analysis and Optimization (MDAO), more specifically as it relates to aerostructural and Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) problems.
