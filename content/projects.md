        I enjoy developing numerical software, such as finite-element and finite-volume solvers. Some examples:
        
        -[SFEM](/sfem): A parallel C++ framework for the numerical solution of PDEs on unstructured meshes

        -[WELDSIM](/weldsim): Thermal simulation of arc welding with AMR 

        -[mSense](/msense):  A Python framework for Multidisciplinary Analysis and Optimization 

        -[ArgParse](https://github.com/dlmpal/argparse): Lightweight parser for command-line arguments in modern C++
